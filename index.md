<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2> Best Buds For Life </h2>
<p2>      This is a short comic strip of my old childhood dog Slider. Slider was my whole world and my best bud. Here is to all the steak, macaroni, peanut butter, ripped socks, stolen shoes and endless walks around the block to last a life time! Our family was so lucky to have someone so special growing up, rest easy Slidog! </p2>

<h2> Mr. November </h2>
<p3>       Derek Jeter is a life legend and always will be. His career is looked up upon most kids all around the world. In my life, Jeter was my favorite player and will be of all time. The way he battle adversity and overcame so many obsticles shows a lot about his character and who he is. I admired Mr. November my entire life with all of his achievemnts he has made for himself. He will forever be the G.O.A.T. </p3>

My visualization works include:

<h2> Map Chart </h2>
Using tableau, I created a map of some of the top California sport stadiums. I am originally from New Jersey, which is a little funny, but have had my mind set on moving to California since the 9th grade. Along with that reason, I'm also a huge sports junky that can never get enough.

<h2> Top Athletes Pay, Salary and Endorsements </h2>
Adding on to my love for sports, I created a visual to show the top 10 most paid athletes in 2016. I collected all the data and made a set on excel. Then I transferred the files over to Tableau to make the actual finished product. These 10 athletes are from all kinds of sports and strictly on their wealth. These men made fortunes through their salary, pay and endorsements and thought it would be interesting to show to the world, as well as being a cool viewing for my github portfolio.

<h2> Lehigh Colleges Enrollment </h2>
My project here is more of an educational piece. I collected the data for Lehigh colleges enrollments and made it into a bar chart. For those of you who didn't know, Lehigh has six different schools you can apply for. This wil show the percentage of the students in each school within Lehigh. Below is the link to my visual I created in Chartbuilder.
