<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p1>       This is a short comic strip of my old childhood dog Slider. Slider was my whole world and my best bud. Here is to all the steak, macaroni, peanut butter, ripped socks, stolen shoes and endless walks around the block to last a life time! Our family was so lucky to have someone so special growing up, rest easy Slidog! </p1>

<p2>       Derek Jeter is a life legend and always will be. His career is looked up upon most kids all around the world. In my life, Jeter was my favorite player and will be of all time. The way he battle adversity and overcame so many obsticles shows a lot about his character and who he is. I've admired Mr. November my entire life. He will forever be the G.O.A.T. </p2>

<h2> Map Chart </h2>
<p3> Using tableau, I created a map of some of the top California sport stadiums. I am originally from New Jersey, which is a little funny, but have had my mind set on moving to California since the 9th grade. Along with that reason, I'm also a huge sports junky that can never get enough. </p3>
